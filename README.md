Hotel Management System

**Technologies Used:** React.js (Frontend), Laravel (Backend API)

Overview:

The Hotel Management System is a modern, full-featured web application designed to streamline the operations of hotels. It provides an intuitive interface for managing bookings, rooms, guests, and invoicingâ€”all powered by a robust RESTful API built with Laravel and a responsive, dynamic frontend developed in React.js.

Key Features:

* **Room Management:**
  Add, update, or remove rooms. Assign bed types, manage availability, room descriptions, pricing, and images.

* **Booking Management:**
  Create, update, and track room bookings in real time. Prevent double-booking by automatically excluding rooms already reserved.

* **Guest Management:**
  Store guest information securely. Easily check guest history and details during check-in and check-out.

* **Invoice & Payment Handling:**
  Generate detailed invoices with itemized billing. Include services like food, amenities, and taxes. Mark invoices as final and track payment status.

* **Status Tracking:**
  Use booking statuses (e.g., pending, confirmed, checked-in, checked-out) to manage room availability and workflow efficiently.

* **Image Gallery:**
  Manage room images with a user-friendly image upload interface. Display the first room image as a preview.

* **Admin Dashboard:**
  View hotel statistics, room availability, recent bookings, earnings, and more via a clean, mobile-friendly admin panel.
